From Inverness follow the A9 north over the Kessock Bridge

At the next roundabout again take the second left to stay on the A835 (sign-posted to Ullapool)

The next village is Contin, about 6 miles from the roundabout

Once in Contin, the entrance to our driveway is the third right (approximately 200 yards) after the petrol station. If you pass the one and only village shop you have gone too far!

The hotel is located up the hill at the end of the half-mile gravel driveway. Please do not be put off by the potholes and ruts that appear occasionally throughout the year after heavy rain. Unfortunately, the driveway is a constant source of maintenance, which we do our best to keep up with.
