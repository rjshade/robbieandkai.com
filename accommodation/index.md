We have exclusive access to the hotel for the nights of Friday 5th July and Saturday 6th July 2013. 

The address is:
[Coul House Hotel, Contin, Scotland, IV14 9ES (click to view map)](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=216947055802982788673.0004c80143f8399bd2190&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;source=embed&amp;ll=57.585087,-4.476929&amp;spn=0.353352,0.878906&amp;z=10)


## Booking a room at Coul House Hotel

###Important:
You must phone the hotel directly to book a room. We have exclusive use for the weekend of our wedding so external booking sites (such as booking.com) will show no availability.
----

Please contact the hotel directly to book a room. They have single rooms, twin rooms, double rooms, and can accommodate groups of 3 or 4 who are willing to share a room (e.g. a family room can be converted into four single beds).

As there are only 21 rooms available, priorities will be given to guests who are planning to lodge on both Friday and Saturday nights.

Remember to mention that you will be attending our wedding when making a booking as we have arranged a deal with the hotel:

* **Double or twin rooms** £150 per night
* **Single rooms** £75 per night

As mentioned there are some rooms that can accommodate 3 or 4 people. These will be charged at £180 (for 3 pp) or £210 (for 4 pp) per night.
